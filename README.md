# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows_data_cleaning-processing
ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Project
This repository contains a simple Python script to demonstrate a typical data cleaning and preprocessing workflow using the Pandas library. The process is crucial for preparing raw data for subsequent analysis, visualization, or machine learning tasks.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The script uses a simulated dataset inspired by the "Medical Appointment No Shows" data from Kaggle. The raw data includes common issues such as:

Missing values (NaN)

Duplicate rows

Inconsistent text formatting

Inconsistent date formats

Incorrect data types (e.g., age as a float, negative age)

Poorly named columns (e.g., No-show with a hyphen)

ðŸš€ How to Run the Script
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and the Pandas library installed. You can install Pandas using pip:

pip install pandas

Execute the Script: Run the data_cleaning.py file from your terminal:

python data_cleaning.py

The script will print the state of the data at various stages of the cleaning process, showing the raw data, and then the final, clean output.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps Performed
The data_cleaning.py script follows a structured approach to clean the dataset:

Column Renaming: Renamed columns to a uniform, clean format (e.g., no-show became no_show).

Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate rows based on the patient and appointment IDs.

Missing Value Handling:

Missing gender values were filled with the most common gender (M or F).

Missing age values were filled with the median age.

Data Validation: Handled invalid data points, such as a negative age, by filtering them out or correcting them.

Data Type Conversion:

Converted age from a float to an integer.

Converted date columns from strings to proper datetime objects.

Data Standardization:

Standardized the gender column to all uppercase (M, F).

Converted the no_show column from 'Yes'/'No' to a binary 1/0 format for easier analysis.

ðŸ“¦ Output
After running the script, the final output will be a cleaned DataFrame printed to the console. In a real-world application, you would typically save this cleaned data to a new CSV file, for example, cleaned_data.csv.
